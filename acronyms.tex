LSSTC & \gls{LSST} Corporation. an Arizona 501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation formed in 2003 for the purpose of designing, constructing, and operating the LSST System. During design and development, the Corporation stewarded private funding used for such essential contributions as early site preparation, mirror construction, and early data management system development. During construction, LSSTC will secure private operations funding from international affiliates and play a key role in preparing the scientific community to use the LSST dataset. \\\hline
NCSA & National Center for Supercomputing Applications \\\hline
OSS & Observatory System Specifications; LSE-30 \\\hline
Object & In LSST nomenclature this refers to an astronomical object, such as a star, galaxy, or other physical entity. E.g., comets, asteroids are also Objects but typically called a Moving Object or a Solar System Object (SSObject). One of the DRP data products is a table of Objects detected by LSST which can be static, or change brightness or position with time. \\\hline
Operations & The 10-year period following construction and commissioning during which the LSST Observatory conducts its survey \\\hline
Operations Rehersal & A data management system prototype project employing the same methods, tools, personnel, and technologies as the real system in order to introduce and validate new algorithms, functionality, and infrastructure. Previously referred to as a data challenge. \\\hline
PSF & Point Spread Function \\\hline
PST & \gls{Project Science Team} \\\hline
Project Manager & The person responsible for exercising leadership and oversight over the entire LSST project; he or she controls schedule, budget, and all contingency funds \\\hline
Project Science Team & an operational unit within LSST that carries out specific scientific performance investigations as prioritized by the Director, the Project Manager, and the Project Scientist. Its membership includes key scientists on the Project who provide specific necessary expertise. The Project Science Team provides required scientific input on critical technical decisions as the project construction proceeds \\\hline
Project Scientist & The principal scientific advisor to the LSST Project Manager to ensure that LSST system specifications are appropriate for achieving the scientific goals of the project; the Project Scientist also works closely with the Systems Engineering group and chairs the LSST Science Council \\\hline
QA & Quality Assurance \\\hline
SRD & LSST Science Requirements; LPM-17 \\\hline
Science Collaboration & An autonomous body of scientists interested in a particular area of science enabled by the LSST dataset, which through precursor studies, simulations, and algorithm development lays the groundwork for the large-scale science projects the LSST will enable.  In addition to preparing their members to take full advantage of LSST early in its operations phase, the science collaborations have helped to define the system's science requirements, refine and promote the science case, and quality check design and development work. \\\hline
Solar System Object & A solar system object is an astrophysical object that is identified as part of the Solar System: planets and their satellites, asteroids, comets, etc. This class of object had historically been referred to within the LSST Project as Moving Objects. \\\hline
Source & A single detection of an astrophysical object in an image, the characteristics for which are stored in the Source Catalog of the DRP database. The association of Sources that are non-moving lead to Objects; the association of moving Sources leads to Solar System Objects. (Note that in non-LSST usage "source" is often used for what LSST calls an Object.) \\\hline
Subsystem & AÂ set of elements comprising a system within the larger LSST system that is responsible for a key technical deliverable of the project. \\\hline
Subsystem Manager & responsible manager for an LSST subsystem; he or she exercises authority, within prescribed limits and under scrutiny of the Project Manager, over the relevant subsystem's cost, schedule, and work plans \\\hline
algorithm & A computational implementation of a calculation or some method of processing. \\\hline
metadata & General term for data about data, e.g., attributes of astronomical objects (e.g. images, sources, astroObjects, etc.) that are characteristics of the objects themselves, and facilitate the organization, preservation, and query of data sets. (E.g., a FITS header contains metadata). \\\hline
patch & An quadrilateral sub-region of a sky tract, with a size in pixels chosen to fit easily into memory on desktop computers. \\\hline
pipeline & A configured sequence of software tasks (Stages) to process data and generate data products. Example: Association Pipeline. \\\hline
sky map & A sky tesselization for LSST. The Stack includes software to define a geometric mapping from the representation of World Coordinates in input images to the LSST sky map. This tesselation is comprised of individual tracts which are, in turn, comprised of patches. \\\hline
tract & A portion of sky, a spherical convex polygon, within the LSST all-sky tessellation (sky map). Each tract is subdivided into sky patches. \\\hline
