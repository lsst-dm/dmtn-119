\subsection{Day 3} \label{sec:day3}

The daily meeting took place as planned at 11:00 \gls{PST}.

Transfers were initiated similar to Day 2 and all data had arrived at the \gls{LDF} by 7:30 am.
Data ingestion {\texttt{/project/OpsRehearsal\_1/night3} required roughly 20 minutes.  
Processing was subsequently initiated but after 30 minutes it was found that jobs had never been submitte to the compute resource.  That resource (a reserved allocation) was found to still be running \gls{QA} from Night 2. An alternate compute resource was identified and jobs re-submitted, finishing $\sim$35 minutes later.

Similar WARN-level problems were identified prior to the daily meeting as were a 
small number of failures, similar to night 1 (number of stars resulting in failed \gls{PSF} modeling).

\subsubsection{Discussion}

Discussions centered on what information needed to be captured from this rehearsal for future rehearsals.
It was felt that this rehearsal proceeded relatively smoothly but did not include processes that could
mimic commissioning team's needs (i.e. fast turn around processing) and ad-hoc processing of data taken
to address specific tests.  The next rehearsal (late 2019/early 2020) is meant to focus toward 
LSST Commissioning with ComCam and should include Commissioning Team members.
